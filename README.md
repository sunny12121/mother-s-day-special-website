	<h1>A Mother's day homage website ðŸ’œ</h1>
</div>

### What is? ðŸ¤”
The 2020's Mother's day coincided with my starting on the programming world. So, I decided to use my new creating websites skills to make a homage to my mom and my wife, who's the mother of my lovely girl child. All website structure and styling were made by me and the texts were write by my sister, who is a psychologist and poetess.
